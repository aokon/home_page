Hey, My name is Adam Okoń. I'm programmer, web developer living in Gdańsk, Poland.
Mostly I'm using [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org), [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) and Javascript to make things done,
but also love learning a new stuff. 
I consider myself as a person which understand both (frontend, backend) worlds. 
I'm active member of our local Ruby user group ([TRUG](http://trug.pl)) as speaker and part of organizer team. 

Besides coding, thinking about new startup, I'm do sports (play football, ride by bike, train Taekwon-do),
read books, travel and spend time with family and friends.
