Probably this post should be released at the beginning of new year when people mostly are making a summary the previous one.
Many things have happened in my life recently. I have found some time to setup my home page, so finally I can start my blog.
In this post I'm going to describe some things which I would like to do during this year.

Change thinking from "must to do" to "I like to do"
----------------------------------------------
I noticed that during creating a task lists, I started thinking about them only in "must do" category.
I realized that this kind of approach, in long term, has negative impact on my work performance.
I started research about this topic, what should be changed to bring me back the joy to may daily work.
As always, solution is so simple. I started planing things which I like to do, not must.

Don't end the week with nothing
-------------------------------
This subject is related with previous one. I'm going to end the week with something that I can share results with others.
It can be blog post, new project, doesn't matter. I found that this approach give me more motivation to learning a new things and in obtaining the objectives.

Tracking objectives
-------------------
At the end, I need better control of the my objectives, because I have feeling that I didn't accomplish all I wanted.
